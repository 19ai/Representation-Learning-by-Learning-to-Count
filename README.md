# Representation Learning by Learning to Count in Tensorflow

As part of the implementation series of [Joseph Lim's group at USC](http://csail.mit.edu/~lim), our motivation is to accelerate (or sometimes delay) research in the AI community by promoting open-source projects. To this end, we implement state-of-the-art research papers, and publicly share them with concise reports. Please visit our [group github site](https://github.com/gitlimlab) for other projects.

This project is implemented by [Shao-Hua Sun](http://shaohua0116.github.io) and the codes have been reviewed by --- before being published.

## Descriptions
This project is a [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) implementation of [Representation Learning by Learning to Count](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06734). 

<!-- <img src="figure/" height="300"/> -->

The implemented model is trained and tested on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/). 

Note that this implementation only follows the main idea of the original paper while differing a lot in implementation details such as model architectures, hyperparameters, applied optimizer, etc. 

\*This code is still being developed and subject to change.
